100\nyears ago.\n   for one thing, no one in 1889 had to worry about a water quality\npermit. for another, they are planning to move an unusually large\nnumber of cattle.\n   but organizers say they're not deterred by questions of\nenvironmental impact or such cowboy insider worries as whether the\ncattle will balk when driven toward a river crossing at midday.\n   the problems will be overcome, they say, and the six-day drive\nwill come off sept. 4 through 9, one of a year-long series of events\ncelebrating montana's admission to the union on nov. 8, 1889.\n   interest in the drive spans several continents, according to jim\nwempner, a billings-area rancher and director of the event. however,\nonly 700 people so far have indicated they will participate, he said.\n   wempner did not know how many cattle that included, but said each\nperson must consign at least one animal.\n   he said he expects the drive to involve 200 wagons and 5,000\ncowboys, including 100 experienced trail hands.\n   ``it's going to happen,'' wempner said, despite numerous\nobstacles stemming from a state-level review of the drive's\npotential environmental impact.\n   ``we do the same thing for 2,000 cattle as we would with 10,000\ncattle,'' he said. ``there's not that much of a difference. this is\njust a larger number.''\n   organizers bill it as one of the largest cattle drives in history.\n   but state officials have questioned whether the sponsors will be\nable to overcome problems, including the handling of wastes created\nby people and livestock along the 58-mile route between roundup and\nbillings.\n   outgoing lt. gov. gordon mcomber, chairman of the state\ncentennial commission, said experienced cattlemen also have\ncriticized the plan.\n   he said they cite behavioral quirks of cattle that could lead to\nproblems, such as a possibility the animals might refuse to cross a\nriver during the heat of the day. the angle of the sun may make it\nimpossible for the cattle to see the bottom, causing them to balk.\n   ``those things are long forgotten in this day and age,'' mcomber\nsaid.\n   organizers need permits and water quality variances to allow\ncattle to cross rivers and streams and possibly air quality\nvariances if cattle are moved along dusty dirt roads, officials said.\n   people from across the united states and two from australia have\napplied to participate, wempner said, adding that filmmakers from\nwest germany, france and switzerland have shown interest in\ndocumenting the event.\n   wempner estimated it would cost $500,000 to stage the drive.\n   among the other events planned for the centennial is a 250-mile\nwagon train trek being organized by the montana draft horse and mule\nassociation.\n   more than 80 wagons, 17 riding groups, 367 horses and 301 people\nare registered and about a half-dozen others are on a waiting list\nfor the trip, planned for june and july.\n", ' ap890101-0001 ': "\n   the celluloid torch has been passed to a new\ngeneration: filmmakers who grew up in the 1960s.\n   ``platoon,'' ``running on empty,'' ``1969'' and ``mississippi\nburning'' are among the movies released in the past two years from\nwriters and directors who brought their own experiences of that\nturbulent decade to the screen.\n   ``the contemporaries of the '60s are some of the filmmakers of\nthe '80s. it's natural,'' said robert friedman, the senior vice\npresident of worldwide advertising and publicity at warner bros.\n   chris gerolmo, who wrote the screenplay for ``mississippi\nburning,'' noted that the sheer passage of time has allowed him and\nothers to express their feelings about the decade.\n   ``distance is important,'' he said. ``i believe there's a lot of\nthinking about that time and america in general.''\n   the vietnam war was a defining experience for many people in the\n'60s, shattering the consensus that the united states had a right,\neven a moral duty to intervene in conflicts around the world. even\ntoday, politicians talk disparagingly of the ``vietnam syndrome'' in\nreferring to the country's reluctance to use military force to\nsettle disputes.\n   ``i think future historians will talk about vietnam as one of the\nnear destructions of american society,'' said urie brofenbrenner, a\nprofessor of sociology at cornell university.\n   ``in world war ii, we knew what we were fighting for, but not in\nvietnam.''\n   ``full metal jacket,'' ``gardens of stone,'' ``platoon,'' ``good\nmorning, vietnam,'' ``hamburger hill'' and ``bat 21'' all use the\nwar as a dramatic backdrop and show how it shaped characters' lives.\n   the vietnam war has remained an emotional issue in the united\nstates as veterans have struggled to come to terms with their\nexperiences. one was oliver stone, who wrote and directed the\nacademy award-winning ``platoon.''\n   ``i saw `platoon' eight times,'' said john j. anderson, a palm\nbeach county sheriff's lieutenant who served in vietnam in 1966-67.\n``i cried the first time i saw it ... and the third and fourth\ntimes. `platoon' helped me understand.''\n   stone, who based ``platoon'' on some of his own experiences as a\ngrunt, said the film brought up issues that had yet to be resolved.\n   ``people are responding to the fact that it's real. they're\ncurious about the war in vietnam after 20 years,'' he said.\n   while southeast asia was the pivotal foreign issue in american\nsociety of the '60s, civil rights was the major domestic issue. the\ncivil rights movement reached its peak in the ``freedom summer'' of\n1964, when large groups of volunteers headed south to help register\nblack voters.\n   in ``five corners,'' a movie about the summer of '64 in the bronx\nstarring jodie foster, her friend, played by tim robbins, leaves his\nneighborhood to volunteer in the south after seeing the rev. martin\nluther king jr. on television.\n   alan parker's ``mississippi burning'' focuses on an incident that\nclouded the mississippi summer project _ when 1,000 young volunteers\nfrom mainstream america swept into the state to help register black\nvoters. the movie is a fictionalized account of the disappearance\nand slaying of three civil rights workers: michael schwerner, andrew\ngoodman and james chaney.\n   they were reported missing on june 21, several hours after being\nstopped for speeding near philadelphia, miss. after a nationally\npublicized search, their bodies were discovered aug. 4 on a farm\njust outside the town.\n   one of those who recalled the incident was gerolmo, a student in\nthe new york public school system at the time. the screenwriter said\nthe incident had a powerful effect on his way of thinking.\n   ``it was the first time i ever considered that our country could\nbe wrong,'' gerolmo said.\n   the film stars willem dafoe and gene hackman star as fbi agents\nwho try to find the bodies of the missing workers and overcome\nfierce local resistance to solve the crime.\n   in a more offbeat and outrageous way, john waters' ``hairspray''\ndiscusses integration in baltimore in 1963 when a group of\nteen-agers tries to break down the barriers of a segregated dance\nshow.\n   also set in baltimore is barry levinson's ``tin men,'' starring\ndanny devito and richard dreyfuss as two slick aluminum siding\nsalesmen in the early '60s. the movie mirrored a squarely\nmiddle-class culture, one that was not caught up in sex, politics\nand drugs.\n   instead of focusing on a well-known historic event,\nwriter-director ernest thompson takes a more personal approach in\n``1969.'' robert downey jr. and keifer sutherland star as college\nstudents who battle their parents and each other over sex, drugs and\nthe vietnam war.\n   ``i was 19 in 1969. it was a fulcrum time for me,'' said\nthompson, who was a student at american university at the time. ``i\nthink it was just the right time in my growth as an artist and as a\nman to try to write about something that happened in my youth.''\n   ``running on empty'' takes place in the '80s but the '60s are\nmuch in evidence. judd hirsch and christine lahti play anti-war\nactivists who sabatoged a napalm plant in 1970 and are forced to\nlive underground with their two children.\n   naomi foner, who wrote ``running on empty'' and also served as\nthe film's executive producer, grew up in brooklyn, n.y., the\ndaughter of sociologists. her own experiences made foner well\nqualified to give ``running on empty'' its strong political theme.\n   ``i lived through that time and i've wanted to find the right way\nto present it to this generation,'' said foner, a member of the\nradical students for a democratic society while attending graduate\nschool at columbia university.\n   foner, who also taught in harlem's head start program and helped\nregister voters in south carolina, said many young people are\ncurious about what happened in the '60s.\n   ``a lot of them think it was an exciting time that they were\nsorry to have missed,'' she said.\n   brofenbrenner said movies are a good indicator of the concerns of\nthe general public: ``the principle impact of the media is that they\nreflect the values of the larger society.\n   ``film is a very powerful art medium,'' he said. ``i believe it\nvery accurately reflects not only the prevailing but the coming\ntrends. it's because film writers, like other writers, are\nperceptive people. they get the message of what's going on.''\n", ' ap890101-0050 ': "\n   more oil-covered sea

damage of\nthe spill that killed millions of fish in parts of the monongahela\nand ohio rivers.\n   ``we have had a major change in the river that has to be studied\nand watched. these are of grave

pittsburgh, who supervised a $750,000\nstudy funded by ashland oil inc., said the most significant effects\nof the spill occurred ``over the short term, and these are largely\npast.''\n   last jan. 2, a rebuilt ashland oil storage tank holding more than\n3.8 million gallons of diesel fuel collapsed at the company's\nterminal 25 miles south of pittsburgh.\n   a tidal wave of 705,000 gallons of oil surged into the\nmonongahela, which was swollen and swift from heavy rains.\n   emergency workers recovered about 30 percent of the fuel. but\nmost of the oil entered the ohio river at downtown pittsburgh and\nkept moving into ohio and west virginia, threatening drinking water\nsupplies for millions of people.\n   about 23,000 suburban pittsburgh residents lost tap water for\nnearly a week until the heaviest pollution passed their water\ncompanies' intakes, and several businesses and schools were closed\nfor a few days.\n   an apologetic ashland oil took the blame and paid the bills. it\nagreed to clean up the soil and ground water at the terminal,\ninspect its 150 facilities nationwide and pay damage claims\nassociated with the spill.\n   the ashland, ky.-based company so far has paid $17 million, or\nabout 80 percent of 6,000 claims, said ashland spokesman roger\nschrum.\n   but the company's contrition didn't spare it from criminal\ncharges, particularly after engineers determined a dime-sized flaw\nin the steel wall of the oil tank caused its collapse and a state\ntask force concluded ashland was negligent.\n   on sept. 15, a federal grand jury indicted ashland on two\nmisdemeanor counts for allegedly violating the federal clean water\nand refuse acts, and a state investigation is still under way.\n   ashland reacted bitterly to the charges and produced a 1986 memo\nfrom the allegheny county fire marshal's office confirming the\ncompany's claim that it had approval to begin construction of the\nrebuilt tank. county officials had long denied that any permission\nwas given.\n   three people in the fire marshal's office, including the chief,\nresigned or were fired over what their superiors called shoddy work\npractices.\n   meanwhile, a flurry of federal and state legislation pertaining\nto above-ground storage tanks has been proposed, but nothing has\nbeen enacted. rep. doug walgren, a pennsylvania democrat, said he\nplans to reintroduce his bill to regulate aboveground storage tanks\nwhen congress returns this month.\n   the spill killed roughly 2,000 ducks nesting along the rivers in\npennsylvania and injured others. few ducklings hatched in the spring.\n   it is believed the kill in pennsylvania was limited to about\n11,000 fish. but downriver in west virginia, about 3 million dead\nfish were counted, a state report said.\n   the higher count in west virginia is believed to be due to a\nslower current and the oil mixing with sediments and sinking to the\nriver bottom, where fish feed in the winter, explained berkey.\n   berkey said heavy rains that began around jan. 19 dispersed the\noil deposited on the river bottom, preventing similar problems\ndownriver.\n   ``the rain pretty much cleaned the system,'' he said. ``the bulk\nof the spill is south of new orleans by now ... but in such diluted\nquantities that it would be difficult to identify.''\n   despite the kill, proch said fishing in the ohio, monongahela and\nallegheny rivers this year was reported to be good.\n   a major cause for concern, however, is an apparent decline of\nminnows, a key food for game fish. but berkey said there have been\nextreme fluctuations in the minnow population in the past decade for\nreasons not known.\n   he agreed that additional studies should be conducted.\n   alan vicory, director of the cincinnati-based ohio river

vehemently reaffirmed\nhis hardline socialist principles sunday in a nationally televised\nspeech marking the 30th anniversary of his communist revolution.\n   ``today, we say with more force than ever: socialism or death,\nmarxism-leninism or death!'' castro said.\n   the speech, which carried one of castro's strongest declarations\nof ideological purity, comes at a time of new challenges in ties\nwith the soviet union, africa, and latin america.\n   cuba's ties with the soviet union appear to have entered a period\nof uncertainty as a result of ideological differences. on other\nfronts, cuban diplomats say a visit here by pope john paul ii may be\npossible in 1989, and cuba has hinted that it wants a more\nconstructive relationship with the united states.\n   as part of the anniversary celebrations this weekend, castro gave\nhis speech sunday night in the main square of the eastern coastal\ncity of santiago. he spoke for almost two hours from the balcony of\nthe building where he proclaimed victory for his guerrilla forces on\nnew year's day, 1959. a large crowd gathered to hear him in cespedes\nplaza next to the building, which is now used as the city hall.\n   castro told them he was maintaining strict adherence to socialist\nprinciples because of the ``enormous responsibility'' cuba has to\nthe peoples of the third world.\n   he devoted much of his speech broadcast on state-run television,\nhowever, to praising the role played by the people of santiago and\nother eastern cities in his revolution and cuba's independence from\nspain in 1902.\n   the cuban leader considers this city, from which he led his\ncommunist guerrillas into revolution, the moral capital of this\ncommunist country. on new year's eve 1958, castro ousted a rightist\ndictatorship, touching off a revolution that has made him the\nundisputed leader of this soviet-allied caribbean nation.\n   but the cuban-soviet friendship, although far from breaking up,\nseems more tenuous now than it has been in decades.\n   a key question is whether soviet unhappiness with the way cuba\nhas used economic aid from the kremlin _ estimated at $5 billion\nannually _ will lead to cutbacks. castro has used the economic aid\nto help build his country's schools and hospitals, the soviets say,\nand has neglected industrial development.\n   castro is an advocate of socialist purity and opposes any policy\nthat borrows from capitalism. he has spoken scornfully of the\npolitical and social reforms proposed by soviet president mikhail\ngorbachev, saying the ``consequences would be hard'' for cuba if the\nsoviet experiment encounters ``serious difficulties.''\n   ``so we may be in for difficulties coming from the enemy camp and\ndifficulties coming from the camp of our own friends,'' he said last\nmonth.\n   the recent cuban commitment to withdraw its 50,000 troops from\nangola by 1991 presents another step toward scaling back cuba's\ninvolvement in international conflicts. cuba has given military\nsupport to many countries, but the commitment to angola was by far\nthe biggest.\n   in latin america, castro has been aggressively pursuing interests\ncommon to other countries in the area. the evolution of democracy in\nlatin america, which has been welcomed by the reagan administration,\nhas also had the ironic side effect of opening diplomatic\nopportunities for castro.\n   the cuban leader, once known for his efforts to promote violent\nrevolution, now seems more interested in pursuing normal ties with\nelected governments.\n   castro attended presidential inagurations in ecuador and mexico\nin recent months and may participate in the inauguration of the\nvenezuelan president next month.\n   during castro's visit to mexico in late november, his first since\nhe was exiled there in the 1960s, he said he envisions the eventual\nunity of cuba and the rest of latin america.\n   ``one day, we will make one big giant,'' he said.\n   western diplomats say castro may be hoping to gain from the\ngrowing restiveness over the devastating social consequences of\nlatin america's $420 billion foreign debt, which has left the region\nmuch poorer than it was a decade ago. castro has long advocated that\nlatin america renounce its debt on grounds it is unpayable.\n   meanwhile, castro has indicated interest in a more relaxed\nrelationship with the united states. in remarks to the national\nassembly last week, he said he would not neglect any opportunity to\nimprove u.s.-cuban relations.\n   a potential obstacle to an accommodation with washington is the\nu.s. plan to beam to cuban audiences a televised version of radio\nmarti, a station operated by the voice of america whose\nanti-communist programs are already

university's computer-integrated manufacturing and packaging\nlaboratory.\n   the lab, established two years ago at a cost of $120,000, is the\nonly project of its kind in the state, and one of the more advanced\nsuch programs in the country.\n   tom akas of the society of manufacturing engineers said ms.\nalptekin has created ``a model for similar laboratories ... students\ncan see how the factory of the future operates.''\n   the society of manufacturing engineers has recognized ms.\nalptekin as an outstanding young manufacturing engineer.\n   in her lab, a conveyer belt at waist level carries parts from\nstorage shelves to a robot that dominates the room like a silent,\n4-foot metal sentry. the robot is a v-shaped, jointed arm on a\npivoting base. the arm can be fitted to allow it to grasp, lift and\nturn objects of differing sizes to suit a variety of tasks. the\nrobot then swivels to place parts in position at the automated lathe\nor milling machine.\n   the entire factory

and placing the\nparts in position with the robot's arm; and shaping parts into\nfinished products at the lathe.\n   students using the lab have designed and produced engraved key\nchains and intricate mazes and puzzles out of plastic and plexiglass.\n   but the product is less important than the process. ms. alptekin\nsaid former students have entered fields as disparate as aviation\nand

integrated,'' ms. alptekin\nsaid, referring to programming that allows components such as the\nautomated storage system to ``talk to'' the computer that controls\nthe manufacturing process, informing it about the availability of\nparts.\n   ms. alptekin said it is this aspect that sets the lab apart even\nfrom industries where robots and automated machines have become\nalmost commonplace. there, she said, robots perform specific tasks\nin ``islands of automation,'' but human workers remain responsible\nfor keeping inventory and coordinating different aspects of the\nproduction line.\n   ms. alptekin said automation is widespread in the automobile\nindustry, but she would like to see it expanded.\n   ``it should be used in any industry,'' she said. ``it's difficult\nto justify economically, but if quality is the concern, then it can\nbe easily justified.\n   ``at least our students will be aware of the enhancements and\ndevelopments in this area, and when they make decisions as engineers\nand managers, they will take this into consideration,'' she said.\n   a master's candidate analyzed the existing system with an eye to\naltering it to create a new product. ms. alptekin said the student\nidentified what new production components were necessary and\ndetermined how they could be integrated into the system.\n   a doctoral candidate is developing computer software that will\nallow the system to diagnose itself. the system could be programmed\nto recognize when a component is not working, and then decide to\nswitch to manufacturing a product that does not involve the disabled\ncomponent, much as human managers would react.\n   graduate student bob borchelt said the equipment he is using is\non the cutting edge of manufacturing.\n   ``truthfully, i can't say that i was expecting this level of\nexpertise,'' he said. ``i know that our lab is one of the best of\nits kind in an educational institution.''\n   the lab, like the entire engineering management program, calls on\ncomputing, mechanical, electrical and chemical skills _ and teamwork.\n   ``for us, for managers, the entire system is important,'' ms.\nalptekin said.\n   ms. alptekin

for just one-third of the city's\nhomicide total.\n   although final population and homicide figures have yet to be\ncompared, washington and detroit had the two highest per-capita\nmurder rates in america in 1988, meaning the nation's capital could\nearn the dubious honor of being the nation's murder capital as well.\n   ironically, the absence of organized crime in washington may be\npushing

which sends\nswarms of officers through drug-infested neighborhoods to make\narrests, has done little more than further clog the city's\nalready-overcrowded jail and court systems.\n   for each drug
